# ABQ Canopy Cover 2020
Mapped from National Agricultural Imagery Service (NAIP) imagery collected during summer 2020.

Code is for the Google Earth Engine web client.

The _training file has an imports section that I don't remember how to share. It looks like this:
![TrainingImports](https://github.com/sbassett/ABQ-Canopy-Cover-2020/assets/3913946/cf02857e-3424-4e20-b531-fb6438764b6b)
My guess is the tutorial linked at the top of the code that I dfollowed includes the steps needed to create those imports.
I'd also be inclined to create the training data in ArcGIS Pro and then import it rather than using this GEE native point creation approach.
